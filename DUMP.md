# ribbon - Initial Brain Dump

create a new CLAUDE.md for this ribbon project.  possibly called ribbow? something cute like that.  

ribbon will be a web app for mobile and desktop (with unique controls making the most of each of those input interfaces) that essentially emulates an analog ribbon synthesizer. My idea comes from the use of a Korg Monotribe.

I'm envisioning the option to control the ribbon itself via trackpad, mouse, touchscreen, keyboard keys, and camera.  user should be able to switch between these modes (or at least the ones available at the moment on that device).  keyboard shortcuts and onscreen buttons should control whether the ribbon is activated (playing, arpegiating or in some kind of latch mode).

it should use some oscillator plugin or some such to implement the sound (like a real analog synthesizer).  there should be easily adjustable knobs and switches and buttons.

it should also have some basic effects like delay, reverb, digitize so the user can actually easily create layered sounds and actually create some music that's real and worth listening to.

user should have the ability to save their composition.

consider idea for being able to launch more than one of these per session.

I want the design to be fun and animated with colors and patterns flowing from the ribbon as the sound is played.  the animations should "go to the music".  they should not interrupt the user's clean experience with the controls though.  the design should be somewhere between a party/candy store and a more creepy sci-fi space ship feel.  Emphasis on animation that actually contributes to the feeling and flow of the music and sound being created.

This will eventually live on it's own domain somewhere, but in the meantime I want it available at ribbon.obfusco.us.  I want to create a staging-deploy agent that runs through the necessary tasks of merging the current branch into staging.


# Friday March 13 additional features

- ribbon logo where the loops of the 'b's in the word connect together via a moebius strip that moves like an infinity ribbon (or magnetic tape)
- turn the grid 3d, like the synth is in the middle of a rolling 3d grid sphere.  there should be 3 spheres, one for each oscillator and each should move accordingly given what's being played and the settings of each oscillator.  they should be loosely on top of one another and moving in different directions.  the user should be able to change the perspective by pressing -/+.  as the user "zooms out" from the spheres they should move apart in 3 different directions.
- the color bars from the top should only be outlines, not filled in
- add 3rd oscillator
- try organizing the controls differently.  the 3 oscillators should line up across the top of the panel they're in, left to right.  vertically aligned for each, top to bottom, the components should be: wave,
